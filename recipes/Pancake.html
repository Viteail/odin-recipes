    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's always nice when the best version of a recipe is also the easiest. Serve with fresh fruit coated in maple syrup!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>Â¾ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almond meal</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine eggs, olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, salt, 
            almond meal, and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk until thoroughly 
            combined. Let batter sit for 10 minutes to marry the flavors and 
            activate the baking powder.</li>
        <li>Butter a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat. Scoop in batter 
            into any size pancake(s) you like. Cook until edges are set and bottom 
            is golden brown, 2 or 3 minutes. Flip and cook until slightly springy to 
            the touch, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
